# Ground Platform

[![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/google/ground-platform/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/google/ground-platform)

Ground is an open-source, map-first data collection platform built
to seamlessly connect the offline world with cloud-based storage and
computation. The platform consists of a web app for survey management, and an
Android app for offline data collection. Our goal is to provide a "just right"
data collection solution that meets the needs of community organizers,
conservationists, humanitarian workers, and researchers addressing some of
today's most pressing issues.

**Note:** Ground is not an officially supported Google product, and is developed
on a best-effort basis.

You can learn more about Ground on the [project
website](https://google.github.io/ground-platform).

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. For more

## Getting started

### Node.js

> **Note**: This guide assumes nvm (Node Version Manager) will be used to
> install and manage Node.js versions. For more information on nvm,
> including installation instructions, see
> https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation>

Once you have nvm installed, install Node.js with:

```
$ nvm install 16 && nvm use 16
```

Then install the Angular CLI using npm using:

```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Quickstart

To get up and running quickly, you can run the web app against the local
Firebase emulator.

To install dependencies and start the emulator, run:

```
$ cd functions && npm install && npm run emulators
```

Leave the emulator running, and in a new shell execute the following:

```
$ cd web && npm install && npm run start:local
```

Once the local server is ready, you can navigate to
http://localhost:4200/survey/new to create a new Ground survey. Note that for
expediency, the above commands start the app without valid API keys, so
warnings related to missing API keys are expected.

### Next steps

To set up your environment for developing Cloud Functions against a real
Firebase project, see [functions/README.md](functions/README.md).

For further instructions on working with the Angular web app, see
[web/README.md](web/README.md).

### Building and Deploying Ground from Source
