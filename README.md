# Ground

Ground is a map-first data collection platform aiming to seamlessly connect the offline world with cloud-based storage and computation. It addresses the needs of non-technical local community members, smallholder farmers, and professionals and researchers working in the areas of climate, sustainability, and humanitarian aid. It consists of a web app for survey management, and an Android app for offline data collection backed by Firebase. 

**Note:** Ground is not an officially supported product; it is being developed and maintained on a best-effort basis.

## Quick start

### 1. Configure

Set up your environment by following instructions in "[first-time setup](https://github.com/google/ground-platform/wiki/Ground-Developer's-Guide#first-time-setup)" before you begin.

### 1. Install deps

```bash 
npm run ci-all
```

### 2. Build and run locally

Build with:

```bash 
npm run build-all --config=local
```

Run against a local Firebase emulator:

```bash
npm run start:local
```

Once the local server is ready, access the web app at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). For development, and testing, the Firebase Emulator Suite UI is accessible at http://localhost:4000. Changes to the web app in `web/` and to Cloud Functions in `functions/` are automatically rebuilt and reloaded on save.

**Note**: The local build variant doesn't require API keys to run, but warnings related to missing Maps API keys will appear in the console. Authentication is also disabled.

The local emulator is preloaded with a demo survey. Run `npm run export:local` to save the updated demo data to the local filesystem for use on the next run.

### Next steps

For instructions on how to deploy to a live dev or prod Firebase project, see the [Ground Developer's Guide](https://github.com/google/ground-platform/wiki/Ground-Developer's-Guide).
