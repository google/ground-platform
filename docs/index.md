Ground is an open-source, map-first data collection platform built in collaboration with non-profits and international organizations with the goal of driving sustainability impact at scale. 

Ground is designed for use by non-technical users with little to no special training. Our goal is to provide a "just right" data collection solution that meets the needs of community organizers, conservationists, humanitarian workers, and researchers.

The platform consists of a web app for survey management, and an Android app for map-based and structured data collection. Key features:

* **Geospatial and structured data collection.** Support for hand-drawn and GPS-based points and polygons, as well as for common data types (text, numbers, multiple-choice questions) and photos.
* **Task-based survey management.** Data collection sites may be determined *a priori* by survey organizers, and/or opportunistically by data collectors.
* **Robust offline support.** Data is automatically synchronized in the background, even after the app has been closed and the device restarted.
* **Offline map imagery.** Cloud-free mosaics based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery can be easily downloaded and viewed offline.
* **Beautiful and usable.** Built on Google's [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) design system to be highly intuitive and nice to look at.

*Important: Ground is not an officially supported Google product. It is being developed on a best-effort basis.*
