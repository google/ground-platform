Ground is an open-source, map-first data collection platform built in collaboration with non-profits and international organizations with the goal of driving sustainability impact at scale. 

Ground is designed for use by non-technical users with little to no special training. Our goal is to provide a "just right" data collection solution that meets the needs of community organizers, conservationists, humanitarian workers, and researchers.

The platform consists of a web app for survey management, and an Android app for map-based and structured data collection. Some key features:

* *Geospatial and structured data collection.* Support for hand-drawn or GPS-based points and polygons.
* *Task-based survey management.* Data collection sites may be determined a priori by survey organizer, and/or opportunistically by data collectors.
* *Robust offline support.* Data is uploaded and refreshed without user intervention.
* *Offline map imagery.* Cloud-free Sentinel-2 imagery can be downloaded and viewed offline.
* *Beautiful and usable.* Built on Google's [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) design system to be highly intuitive and nice to look at.

*Important: Ground is not an officially supported Google product. It is being developed on a best-effort basis.*
