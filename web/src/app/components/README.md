# Ground web Angular components

This directory contains the Angular components used by the Ground web application. 

With the exception of `shared`, each directory in this folder represents a single
page of the web application. Subdirectories recursively contain components used by
the pages in their parent directory.

Components used by two or more pages should be placed in the `shared` directory.
